# Problem Statement: Predicting Game Success on Steam Based on Release Features

- **Context**:

  - Thousands of games are released yearly on platforms like Steam.
  - Only a subset of these games achieve notable success, often measured by:
    - Popularity
    - Player engagement
    - Positive reception

- **Challenges**:
  - Despite abundant data, it remains difficult for developers/publishers to pinpoint which features contribute most to game success.

- **Project Objective**:
  - Develop a predictive model to forecast game success using **features available before release**.

- **Success Metrics**:
  - Peak concurrent users (`peak_ccu`)
  - Positive reviews (`positive`)
  - Negative reviews (`negative`)
  - Estimated owners (`estimated_owners`) 
    - Primary indicator of **sales and overall success**

- **Feature Focus**: 
  - Use **pre-release features** that developers control, such as:
    - Pricing
    - Genre
    - Platform availability
    - DLC count
  - Goal: Provide practical, actionable insights.

- **Methodology**:
  - Use **regression analysis** and **feature importance ranking**.
  - Assess both individual and combined effects of variables on success outcomes.

- **Potential Insights**:
  - Identify key factors correlated with user engagement and satisfaction, such as:
    - Optimal pricing strategies
    - Genre preferences
    - Platform choices
  - Provide guidance for:
    - Game design
    - Marketing strategies
    - Release planning

- **Goal**:
  - Create a **decision-support tool** for developers, publishers, and stakeholders.
  - Equip them with **data-driven strategies** to maximize game success on Steam.
  - Address industry's need for evidence-based strategies to understand how **early decisions** impact a game's post-launch trajectory.
