    "# Minesweeper: Game Rules and Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The goal of Minesweeper is to clear a board containing hidden mines without detonating any. To win, you must reveal all squares that do not contain mines. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Board\n",
    "- The board is a grid of squares, each of which may contain a mine or be empty.\n",
    "- Each square can be one of the following:\n",
    "  - **Unrevealed**: Hidden; the player cannot see what lies beneath.\n",
    "  - **Revealed**: Exposed; the player can see whether it contains a mine or a number.\n",
    "  - **Flagged**: Marked by the player to indicate a suspected mine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Rules\n",
    "1. **Revealing a Square**: \n",
    "   - When a player clicks on an unrevealed square, one of two things will happen:\n",
    "     - **Mine**: If the square contains a mine, the game ends (a loss).\n",
    "     - **Empty Square**: The square reveals a number, indicating how many adjacent squares (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) contain mines.\n",
    "2. **Numbered Squares**:\n",
    "   - Numbers range from 1 to 8, corresponding to the count of adjacent mines.\n",
    "   - If the revealed square has no adjacent mines (indicated by a blank or \"0\"), it reveals neighboring squares automatically, creating a chain effect until all adjacent numbers are uncovered.\n",
    "3. **Flagging Mines**:\n",
    "   - Players can flag squares to indicate they suspect a mine's location.\n",
    "   - However, to simplify simulating the game, we will not implement flagging in this project.\n",
    "     - AI agents are perfectly capable of playing without flagging.\n",
    "4. **Winning the Game**:\n",
    "   - To win, the player must reveal all squares that do not contain mines.\n",
    "   - Once all non-mine squares are revealed, the game is won, regardless of remaining flagged squares.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the task of solving minesweeper with an agent is not suitable for the application of these 7 algorithms, we will focus first on solving the sub-problem of implementing the `reveal_square` function in Minesweeper. This function is responsible for revealing a square on the board and cascading the reveal to adjacent squares if the revealed square is empty (i.e., has no neighboring mines). The `reveal_square` function is a crucial component of the Minesweeper game logic, and implementing it correctly is essential for the game to function as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "- **`r`** (int): The row index of the square to reveal.\n",
    "- **`c`** (int): The column index of the square to reveal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns\n",
    "- **`False`** if a mine is revealed, indicating the game is lost.\n",
    "- **`True`** if no mine is revealed, allowing the game to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applicable Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The following search algorithms are applicable to implementing the `reveal_square` function in Minesweeper. These algorithms facilitate the efficient traversal and revelation of squares on the game board, especially when cascading reveals are necessary due to empty squares (i.e., squares with no neighboring mines).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: BFS explores the game board level by level, starting from the initial square and moving outward to all neighboring squares before proceeding to the next level of neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application in `reveal_square`**:\n",
    "- When a square with no neighboring mines is revealed, BFS can systematically reveal all adjacent squares.\n",
    "- BFS ensures that all squares at the current distance from the initial square are revealed before moving deeper, which is efficient for uncovering large contiguous areas without mines.\n",
    "- This approach prevents stack overflow issues that can occur with deep recursion in large boards, as BFS uses an iterative approach with a queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Depth-First Search (DFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, delving deep into one area of the board before moving to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application in `reveal_square`**:\n",
    "- DFS can be used to recursively reveal squares starting from the initial square, diving deep into adjacent empty squares.\n",
    "- This method is straightforward to implement using recursion or an explicit stack, making it intuitive for handling the cascading reveal logic.\n",
    "- While DFS may explore a particular path extensively before others, it effectively uncovers all connected empty squares, ensuring comprehensive revelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Depth-Limited Search (DLS)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: DLS is a variation of DFS that imposes a limit on the depth of exploration to prevent excessive resource consumption and potential infinite loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application in `reveal_square`**:\n",
    "- In scenarios where the game board is exceptionally large, DLS can limit the depth of recursive reveals to maintain performance and avoid stack overflows.\n",
    "- By setting an appropriate depth limit, DLS ensures that the `reveal_square` function remains efficient, especially in edge cases with extensive empty regions.\n",
    "- If the depth limit is reached without revealing all necessary squares, additional strategies (such as increasing the limit or switching to another algorithm) can be employed to complete the revelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: IDS combines the space efficiency of DFS with the breadth-wise exploration of BFS by repeatedly applying DLS with increasing depth limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application in `reveal_square`**:\n",
    "- IDS can be utilized to progressively reveal squares, starting with a shallow depth and incrementally increasing it to uncover more distant squares.\n",
    "- This approach ensures that the revelation process remains both thorough and resource-conscious, adapting to the complexity of the board dynamically.\n",
    "- IDS is particularly useful in situations where the optimal depth for revelation is unknown, providing a balanced method that mitigates the limitations of both BFS and DFS individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Applicable Algorithms\n",
    "The following algorithms are not applicable to the `reveal_square` function in its current form:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: UCS is designed to find the least-cost path in a graph where each edge has an associated cost.\n",
    "   - **Why Not Applicable**: The Minesweeper cell-revealing process doesn't involve varying costs between cells. Each move (revealing a cell) has an implicit, uniform cost, rendering UCS unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Greedy Search**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Greedy Search prioritizes nodes based on a heuristic that estimates \"closeness\" to a goal, aiming to reach the goal as quickly as possible.\n",
    "   - **Why Not Applicable**: Minesweeper’s cell-revealing process doesn’t benefit from heuristic estimations. There is no specific \"goal\" beyond safely revealing cells, and all cells are treated equally, without prioritization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Astar Search**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: A* combines features of UCS and Greedy Search by using both path cost and heuristic estimates to find the most efficient path.\n",
    "   - **Why Not Applicable**: Like UCS and Greedy Search, A* requires path costs and heuristic functions, which are irrelevant in Minesweeper. The game’s cell-revealing process has no such metrics, making A* inapplicable.\n",
